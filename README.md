## Simple Database Challenge by Thumbtack (in Rust)

An implmenetation of the Simple Database Challenge in roughly 200 lines of Rust. The original [page](http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges/simple-database) seems to be gone, but this [wiki](https://gitlab.com/nehaleadz/Simple-Database-Challenge/-/wikis/home) provides a good overview. In short, it is a simple in-memory key/value store with support for nested transactions, with the additional feature of counting the number of occurrences of a particular value (akin to a reverse index).

## How to run

Install the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) toolchain to build and run the program.

```shell
cargo run
```
